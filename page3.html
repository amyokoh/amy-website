    <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review </h2>
    <h3>  Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?  </h3>
    <p>
        Visual studio code was useful and with the syntax highlighter it makes it easier for me to make changes on my codes when error message appears. The drawback of visual studio is that sometimes when working with the html the plugin does not work properly.I could have been more productive and efficiency if i had more time to work on my website and rearrange some things the way i wanted it .
    
    </p>
    
    <h3> Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency  </h3>
    <p>I will set and track goals to ensure what need to be done and how it will be executed.I will also ensure i understand the magnitude of work involved, clarify tasks, time management and how i want my website to look like. Not having too many ideas to avoid confusing myself. I will definitely take enough breaks to clarify my head to avoid been stuck on a particular task for a very long time.

    </p>
    <h3>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?  </h3>
    
    <p>To improve my own productivity, i will definitely need to collaborate with team of professionals that have experiences in digital project to enhance my website. I will also use slack because it is very useful for team collaboration. The group channel, direct message, file sharing , video and audio calling features of slack will help my chosen team  share knowledges and communicate effectively.  

    </p>
    <h3> Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions  </h3>
    <p>I will use google analyst to understand what devices and softwares are used to access my site.This will help me to clarify the scope of my testing.I will test some of the functions across the browsers to make sure the outcome is what am expecting.I will check the devices, operating systems and browsers that have warranty in order not to waste my time and resources on testing combinations which are not going to be covered.
