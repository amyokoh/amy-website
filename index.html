   <h3>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
 <p> IT has become very useful in modern business planning. IT has to do with computer applications, in which every large or small companies rely on. Most companies uses email, live chat and video conferencing apps to communicate faster. It is use to store data electronically and it helps companies to track sales, expenses, to know which piece of items need to be ordered in case the demand of that item was high and they are running low.

<h3> Methods,skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
<p>
   Digital projects are products developed and digitally delivered to the users. There are Methodologies used for a successful project.Scoping is one of the methods used and is the initial ideas, evaluating your ideas to look for possible threats and challenges that might arise and checking the costs and market.Planning is the next step to start implementing your ideas, involving the creative teams and to submit the requirements and design for development.The development process which follow up from back-ends to front-ends and final adjustment will be made to get ready for testing.The deployment and testing of the code will proceed to check the quality before the product is release to the users. The product will be transferred to the maintenance team to offer support to the users, improves the functions and the stability of the product [1]. Skills needed for digital projects are having attention to details; able to multi-task and get things done on time; ability to communicate strongly, collaborating skills and a problem solver[2].Resources needed for digital projects are project task list and reporting eg trello; project communication eg zoom and using Git and Github to share files[3].

<h3> Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h3>
  <div>
     <p>Firstly, i will think about the purpose of my website. Is it for business to sell my products or is it for educational purposes?. Next step will be budgeting to determine the cost of the projects. I will research the market by shopping around and asking more experience website developers for advice. After budgeting , I will create a content for my site and decide if i want to includes features like videos and pictures. I will also decide how many pages i will want on my sites and what to include on the pages such as about and contact pages.I will start designing by using easy to read font and show a background colour that will attract more users. I will keep the site light to load quickly.Next step will be to test my site with different devices to check for bugs and make sure all the links works before launching.lastly, i will monitor my site to see how many people are using it, the most popular page and the type of devices they use to access it.

<h3> Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
<div>
<p>
   I need to know what i want the software to do; write down the requirements needed for the software; make a list of relevant applications and compare them using comparison sites in order to exclude the unsuitable applications. I will start trialling the selected software by checking if it is easy for the first time user and finally addressing the business needs like support needed, service availability and what the payment terms will be .

<h3> Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h3>
<div>
<p>Trello helped me to keep my outcomes organised. Each board is categorised with lists. Each list cards are labelled from to do list up to done. This helped me to keep a steady workflow and keep myself informed on which stage i am and what to do next. Git allows me to record changes to files. It makes it easy for me to go back to specific files and make changes or correct errors on my codes.Using online platform like Github to store files means that i have the online back up of my codes.

<h3> Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
<div>
   <p>As a developer, you must follow the GDPR compliance when dealing with customer datas. You must get permission from the customer before storing or using their datas and there should an opt-out button for your customer to click incase they want out. You should only hold datas that you need and delete the once not needed. You should have sufficient security to prevent datas been leak either accidentally or deliberately. Staff should be trained to avoid data breach.You have to be ready to answer to breach if there is any breach.
