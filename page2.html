<h2> Unit 1, Outcome 2</h2>
<h3> Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
<p>
    I was happy using visual studio code to develop my website. Visual syntax highlighter is available for almost every programming language. It will let me know if i miss any tags in HTML and also close the tags for me on it's own when i open a tag.The extension library is great and easy to use.
</p>
    
<h3> Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trell</h3>
<p>
    As a junior coder visual studio code provides me with basic support for HTML programming when building my first website.There are smart completions with intellisense which always suggest HTML element closure. I also used trello to keep track  what i was doing. With each cards assigned, i was able to view and monitor what i was doing and what need to be done. This makes my work easier and organised as i checklist on the go.
</p>
<h3>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h3>
<p>
    My strengths are to use HTML codes to create my first website.I also used codes on CSS to manipulate font sizes, colours and position some of the headings to where i want them to be. Some of my weaknesses are not having enough time to create the kind of website i would love to do like putting buttons, contact and about me page, and also learn more on some of the HTML shortcuts.I do not have enough training to learn some of interesting codes on CSS that will make my website look more attractive.
</p>

<h3>Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h3>
<p>
    I will create buttons that clearly marked with an action word to enable my website users to navigate easily and get exactly what they want in the location they expect to find it. I will like to optimise the pages speed to ensure that the users are not frustrated while waiting for the pages to load. I will also use put more images and link to make the website interesting.
</p>

<h3>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose  </h3>
<p>
    I have reviewed all the steps taken in creating my website and they met all the requirements eg creating background colour ,font sizes and headings.I have tested all the pages i created in my site and they are all working and fit for the purpose.
